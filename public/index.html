                I am currently studying at the University of Alberta, completing a bachelors of science with a specialization in Computing Science.
                Since beginning at the University in 2018, I have had the opportunity to learn many skills in Software Practice, Machine Learning, and Database Systems.
                Outside of my study of Computing Science, I have been able to study other subjects including ArcGIS and Economics.
                I had the opportunity to work during the summer of 2020 at EvMware, where I worked on writing web services in C# and SQL.
                Furthermore, I spent my second year working as a Resident Assistant at the University of Alberta, giving me the opportunity to strengthen my interpersonal skills.
                I am also currently heavily involved in the aviation community. I currently hold a Student Pilot Permit and have been able to fly a plane alone
                since before I could drive alone!
            </p>

                What I Have to Offer
            </h2>
            <p>
                I am very capable in team settings and can consistently perform when presented with new challenges.
                Having previous experience in software development means that I have a strong understanding of industry practice and the development challenges faced in the industry.
                I can work independently and reliably deliver software on a continual basis thanks to previous experience.
                Having experience in aviation, I am detail-oriented and confident managing many tasks simultaneously.
